Hi, folks.

That me introduce my idea - EUCLID library(module). I hope it will be a great library! :-)

This library realize object-oriented "engine" for 2D-geometry objects.

For whom this stuff - 2D-game developers, planymetria task developers and may be someone else.

This library make an hierarchy of objects in EUCLID plane.

The aim of this project - make quick and light decision for manipulation 
with objects in 2D-plane on the base of standart python libraries 
with simple and full interface for developers.
